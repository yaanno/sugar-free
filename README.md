# Sugar free code experiments

I'm trying not to use syntactic sugar in JS. It's not that hard... Inspired by Doug Crockford's talk about the Better Parts of JS.

Maybe TypeScript is not needed at all? :o

## Examples

- `node point.js`
- `node point.class.js`
- `npx ts-node point.ts`

## TODO

- test runner
-
